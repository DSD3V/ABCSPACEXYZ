This process repeats until iron appears at the core. The iron fusion reaction absorbs energy, which causes the core to collapse. Most of the star material is blasted away into space, but the core implodes into a neutron star or a singularity known as the black hole. Less massive stars don’t explode, their cores contract instead into a tiny, hot star known as the white dwarf while the outer material drifts away.',
